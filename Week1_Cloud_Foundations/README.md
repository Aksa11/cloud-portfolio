Understand how the cloud platforms are structured (regions, services, IAM, billing) and deploy static site.

# Here’s what I learned and accomplished:

⦾ Understood AWS Regions and Availability Zones (AZs) and why they matter for reliability and performance.

⦾ Hands-on experience in AWS IAM.

⦾ Explored compute and storage services like EC2, Lambda, S3, and EBS.

⦾ Deployed my first static website on AWS S3 in the London region. (https://shorturl.at/w2Dou)

⦾ Learned where to check billing and usage dashboards to monitor costs.
